# GMforPDA

Current version: `2.1`.

### KNOWN ISSUES
Currently none! Yay!

### INSTALL STEPS
Simply copy the code (available [here](GMforPDA.raw.user.js) in minified form) and add as a script to PDA. Set the run-time as document-start so it can inject before all your other scripts. Remember to disable/delete when you see a PDA update with a new version mentioned in the changelog!
